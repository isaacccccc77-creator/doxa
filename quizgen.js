/*
 * QuizGen — turns raw notes text into flashcards / multiple-choice
 * questions entirely client-side (no network, no API keys).
 *
 * Approach: split into sentences, score candidate keywords per sentence
 * (frequency across the doc, length, capitalization, numerals), detect
 * "X is/means/refers to Y" definition sentences for higher-quality
 * question/answer pairs, and fall back to cloze deletion (blank the
 * best keyword) for everything else. Distractors for multiple choice
 * are pulled from other keywords/terms found in the same notes.
